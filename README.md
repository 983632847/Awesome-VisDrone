## Dataset

### VisDrone
The VisDrone2019 dataset is collected by the AISKYEYE team at Lab of Machine Learning and Data Mining , Tianjin University, China. The benchmark dataset consists of 288 video clips formed by 261,908 frames and 10,209 static images, captured by various drone-mounted cameras, covering a wide range of aspects including location (taken from 14 different cities separated by thousands of kilometers in China), environment (urban and country), objects (pedestrian, vehicles, bicycles, etc.), and density (sparse and crowded scenes). Note that, the dataset was collected using various drone platforms (i.e., drones with different models), in different scenarios, and under various weather and lighting conditions. These frames are manually annotated with more than 2.6 million bounding boxes of targets of frequent interests, such as pedestrians, cars, bicycles, and tricycles. Some important attributes including scene visibility, object class and occlusion, are also provided for better data utilization.

### UAV123
Video captured from low-altitude UAVs is inherently different from video in popular tracking datasets like OTB50, OTB100, VOT2014, VOT2015, TC128, and ALOV300++. Therefore, we propose a new dataset (UAV123) with sequences from an aerial viewpoint, a subset of which is meant for long-term aerial tracking (UAV20L). Our new UAV123 dataset contains a total of 123 video sequences and more than 110K frames making it the second largest object tracking dataset after ALOV300++. All sequences are fully annotated with upright bounding boxes.

### DOTA
DOTA-v1.5 contains 0.4 million annotated object instances within 16 categories, which is an updated version of DOTA-v1.0. Both of them use the same aerial images but DOTA-v1.5 has revised and updated the annotation of objects, where many small object instances about or below 10 pixels that were missed in DOTA-v1.0 have been additionally annotated. The categories of DOTA-v1.5 is also extended. Concretely, the category of container crane is added.

### UAVDT
Selected from 10 hours raw videos, about 80; 000 represen-tative frames are fully annotated with bounding boxes as well as up to 14 kinds of attributes (e.g., weather condition, fying altitude, camera view, vehicle category, and occlusion) for three fundamental computer vision tasks: object detection, single object tracking, and multiple object tracking.
